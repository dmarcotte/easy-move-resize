# ![icon](easy-move-resize/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/icon_32x32.png) Easy Move+Resize

Adds easy `modifier key + mouse drag` move and resize to OSX

## Usage

**Easy Move+Resize** is based on behavior found in many X11/Linux window managers

![Menu](asset-sources/doc-img/menu.png)

- `Cmd + Ctrl + Left Mouse` anywhere inside a window, then drag to ***move***.
- `Cmd + Ctrl + Right Mouse` anywhere inside a window, then drag to ***resize***,
    - The resize direction is determined by which region of the window is clicked. *i.e.* a right-click in roughly the top-left corner of a window will act as if you grabbed the top left corner, whereas a right-click in roughly the top-center of a window will act as if you grabbed the top of the window.
    - To use the middle mouse button as the resize modifier, select the `Middle Click resize` menu item.
- The choice of modifier keys to hold down to activate dragging or resizing can be customized by toggling the appropriate modifier key name in the application icon menu.
    - Click the menu item to toggle it.
    - All keys toggled to selected must be held down for activation.
- Behavior can be disabled by toggling the `Disabled` item in the application icon menu.
- If you are dragging or resizing a window in the background and want it to rise to the top, select the `Bring Window to Front` menu item.
- To restore application settings, select the `Reset to Defaults` menu item.
- To disable for a particular app, select `Disable for ...` from the menu after using **Easy Move+Resize** on that app.
